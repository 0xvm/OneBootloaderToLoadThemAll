One Bootloader to Load Them All - Research materials, Code , Etc.

This repository contains as much information as possible to help in understanding the issues we found.
We also included an OVMF image for you to run with QEMU and practice without risking any "live" system.

NOTE!
Playing with bootloaders on your own, or any other system can lead to it failing to boot.

This is for educational purposes only, use at your own discretion.
